# Global Seismic Trends

## Project Overview
Global Seismic Trends is a data analysis project focused on understanding earthquake patterns worldwide. The project leverages a cleaned and structured earthquake dataset, stored in MySQL, to generate meaningful insights on seismic activity.

## Key Highlights
- Analyzes earthquake magnitude, depth, frequency, and location trends.
- Provides insights into casualties, economic impact, and tsunami occurrences.
- Identifies seismic patterns across countries, regions, and time periods.
- Evaluates data reliability using quality metrics like RMS, gap, and station coverage.
- Interactive dashboard allows dynamic exploration and visualization of earthquake trends.

## Usefulness
This project helps researchers, policymakers, and disaster management teams:
- Monitor and compare earthquake-prone regions.
- Understand temporal and spatial trends in seismic activity.
- Assess potential risk factors and preparedness needs.
- Make data-driven decisions for disaster mitigation and emergency planning.

## Technologies
- **MySQL:** Structured storage and querying of earthquake data.
- **Python & Pandas:** Data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis.
- **Streamlit:** Interactive dashboard for real-time exploration and visualization.
